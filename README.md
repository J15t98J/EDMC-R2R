- Each system has a separate page, with bodies listed along with their body types to make it easier to find in FSS where necessary.
- R2R will automatically tick off bodies as you surface scan them, or you can tick them off manually.
- When all bodies in a system have been scanned, R2R will advance to the next page and copy the next system name to your clipboard. You can also move between pages yourself using the buttons at the top.
